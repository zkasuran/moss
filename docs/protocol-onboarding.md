# Protocol onboarding

One Protocol package owns its ABIs, Capabilities, Queries, declared Protocol dependencies, and Receipt parsers.

## 0. Start from the template

Copy the workspace package instead of creating build and test configuration by hand:

```bash
cp -R packages/protocols/_template packages/protocols/myprotocol
pnpm install
```

Rename the package to `@themoss/protocol-myprotocol`, remove `"private": true` when it is ready to publish, and replace every `CHANGEME` marker.

Keep the template tests running while you replace the example. The package remains part of the workspace, so normal root build, typecheck, lint, and test commands exercise it.

## 1. Establish ABI and address provenance

Every ABI under `src/abis/` declares one origin:

- `compiled`: generated from committed contract source;
- `explorer`: retrieved from a verified-contract page with URL and date;
- `vendored`: generated deterministically from committed full upstream artifacts with package version and tarball digest.

Follow [ADR 0007](./adr/0007-abi-origin.md). Never hand-transcribe an ABI or generate a hand-selected function subset. A vendored ABI can additionally be cross-checked against the explorer-verified implementation behind the protocol's proxies: ship a `test:abi:online` script (the root command and the ABI cross-check workflow pick it up automatically) and build the suite from `@themoss/abi-tools` — `fetchAbi`, `compareDeployedAbi`, and the ERC-1967 helpers. See ADR 0007 and `packages/protocols/kuru` (`abis.json` + `test-online/`) for the reference implementation.

### Fetch an explorer ABI

Export an [Etherscan API key](https://info.monadscan.com/myapikey/), then run the repository command:

```bash
export MONADSCAN_API_KEY=…
pnpm fetch-abi 0x1b81D678ffb9C0263b24A97847620C99d213eB14 swapRouter \
  > packages/protocols/myprotocol/src/abis/swap-router.ts
```

The command calls the official Etherscan V2 ABI endpoint for Monad mainnet, prints the complete verified ABI as `export const swapRouterAbi = [...] as const`, and stamps its public Monadscan source URL and UTC retrieval date. It writes TypeScript only to stdout and diagnostics only to stderr. For repeatable regeneration, give the package an `update:abis` script that drives `@themoss/abi-tools`' `fetchAbi` + `renderAbiModule` from a committed source table, and pin the committed modules to the renderer's exact output with a derivation test (see `packages/protocols/pancakeswap/scripts/` and its `test/abis.test.ts`).

Every fixed address cites a canonical source and has an on-chain bytecode check. Fixed token constants additionally verify expected metadata. Dynamic pools and tokens come from chain state and do not become global constants.

## 2. Export a self-describing Protocol

A package exports its public `@Protocol` classes directly from its entry point. Registry registers either one class or every top-level Protocol export in a selected module namespace; ABIs and helpers are ignored.

```ts
@Protocol({
  name: "myprotocol",
  category: "dex",
  description: "One sentence an Agent can use to choose this Protocol.",
  contracts: {
    router: { abi: RouterAbi, addr: ROUTER_ADDRESS },
  },
  labels: {
    Router: ROUTER_ADDRESS,
  },
  protocols: {
    erc20: ERC20,
  },
})
export class MyProtocol {
  declare router: Handle<typeof RouterAbi>;
  declare erc20: ProtocolRef<ERC20>;
}
```

Protocol dependencies are explicit. Registry recursively registers them and injects typed instances. Calling an injected Capability creates a nested Capability node; calling an injected Query returns data directly.

`labels` names fixed Package addresses independently of Handles. Registry renders the example above as `Package(Myprotocol:Router)`, validates the combined payload inside the Core-owned wrapper as a safe 1–32 character name, and exposes it through declared dependency and Receipt parser caller scopes. Receipt parsers still emit raw evidence-backed addresses; Registry owns presentation.

### Parameterized Protocols

When a Protocol's contract identity is dynamic, declare it once as a binding instead of repeating it in every method's params. The schema pairs parameter declarations with a synchronous derivation of that instance's contract configs, and the binding type follows from the schema:

```ts
const vaultBinding = bindingSchema({
  params: {
    vault: { type: Address, description: "Vault contract this instance uses." },
  },
  contracts: ({ vault }) => ({ vault: { abi: VaultAbi, addr: vault } }),
});

@Protocol({
  name: "myvault",
  category: "token",
  description: "One sentence an Agent can use to choose this Protocol.",
  contracts: {},
  binding: vaultBinding,
})
export class MyVault {
  declare vault: Handle<typeof VaultAbi>;
}

export type MyVaultFactory = ProtocolFactory<MyVault, typeof vaultBinding, "depositReceipt">;
```

Binding validation is synchronous and reads nothing external, so a malformed binding fails before any Protocol method runs and before any RPC. Export the factory alias for consumers: it names your Protocol, its binding schema and the Receipt parsers you publish. A parser you leave out is not on the surface, and a Capability or Query is never on it.

A Protocol that declares a parameterized dependency receives that factory:

```ts
@Protocol({
  name: "myrouter",
  category: "dex",
  description: "One sentence an Agent can use to choose this Protocol.",
  contracts: {},
  protocols: { vaults: MyVault },
})
export class MyRouter {
  declare vaults: MyVaultFactory;

  // In a Capability: create as many independent instances as the operation needs.
  //   const first = this.vaults.create({ vault: params.first });
  //   const nested = await first.deposit({ amount: params.amount });
  //
  // In a Receipt parser: delegate through the binding-free parsers.
  //   this.vaults.receipts.depositReceipt(changes)
}
```

`create` is uncached, so two calls carrying the same address are two execution-scoped instances that cannot share state. Registry serializes the canonical binding onto each parameterized CapabilityNode and `load` describes it beside, and separately from, the method's params. Receipt parsing never receives or trusts that binding.

## 3. Define parameter contracts

Each field pairs a reusable Zod value contract with a description of that field's role.

```ts
const swapParams = {
  user: {
    type: Address,
    description: "Account whose assets the swap may spend.",
  },
  tokenIn: {
    type: TokenReference,
    description: "Token provided to the swap.",
  },
  tokenOut: {
    type: TokenReference,
    description: "Token requested from the swap.",
  },
  amountIn: {
    type: PositiveDecimalString,
    description: "Amount of tokenIn to spend.",
  },
  slippageBps: {
    type: BasisPoints.default(50),
    description: "Maximum allowed slippage for this swap.",
  },
} satisfies ParamsSpec;

type SwapParams = InferParams<typeof swapParams>;
```

`BasisPoints` describes only the value: an integer basis-point count, `1 bps = 0.01%`, valid range, and examples. It does not mention swaps or slippage. The field description supplies that purpose. A default of `50` means `0.5%`.

Registry parses action input with the composed schemas. `load` returns JSON-safe generated schemas and both descriptions; Zod objects never cross MCP.

## 4. Author one transaction per Capability

Every Capability owns exactly one direct transaction and one registered Receipt parser. More transactions require nested Capabilities. The serialized Capability tree carries `protocol + method`; Registry resolves the Receipt name from the registered Capability metadata.

```ts
@Capability<MyProtocol, typeof swapParams>({
  intent: "Swap {amountIn} of {tokenIn} into {tokenOut}",
  verb: "swap",
  params: swapParams,
  receipt: "swapReceipt",
  risk: ["fundOut", "approval", "priceImpact"],
})
async swap(params: SwapParams) {
  const approval = await this.erc20.approve({
    token: params.tokenIn,
    spender: this.router.address,
    amount: amountInBaseUnits.toString(),
  });
  const transaction = this.router.swap(/* protocol arguments */);
  return [approval, transaction];
}
```

Here `approval` is a nested ERC Capability with its own direct transaction and Receipt. `transaction` is the one direct TransactionNode owned by `swap`. A contract-level multicall is still one transaction.

The authoring method may use local bigint or viem helpers while constructing calldata. Values stored in the serializable Capability tree use JSON-safe forms such as decimal strings.

## 5. Parse actual Changes with a Receipt

```ts
@Receipt()
swapReceipt(changes: readonly Change[]): ReceiptResult<SwapOutcome> {
  // Decode, loop, branch, and delegate as required by this Protocol.
  // Every ReceiptChange must retain the exact input Change object.
  return buildSwapReceipt(changes);
}
```

A Receipt parser receives only the immutable ordered Changes for one successful direct transaction. It cannot receive Capability parameters or transaction data and cannot call Runtime, Handle, Query, or RPC.

It may call another Protocol's pure Receipt parser for a continuous Change interval and embed the returned Receipt. Package parsers author `ReceiptResult`; Core attaches the producing Protocol name to every parser call and returns the identified `Receipt` through injected dependency references, Registry, and Simulator.

Parsing strategy belongs to the Protocol: ordinary loops, queues, and branches are allowed. Core provides no grammar engine or semantic matcher.

Core only flattens ReceiptChange leaves and checks exact object identity, length, and order against the input.

Receipt text is presentation. The structured Outcome is authoritative and must use JSON-safe values.

After the root parser returns, Registry replaces standalone addresses in every Receipt and ReceiptChange text once. At each Receipt, resolution is `Trusted(name)`, the current `Package(Title Cased Slug:localName)`, nearest-to-farthest caller Packages, one unambiguous Package from the current Protocol's dependency graph, then the raw address. ReceiptChange text inherits its containing Receipt's scope; unrelated, conflicting, and unknown addresses stay raw. Outcomes, data, and Change objects are not rewritten.

## 6. Export and compose

The package entry point exports the Protocol class:

```ts
export { MyProtocol } from "./my-protocol.js";
```

The application composition root imports selected module namespaces and supplies them with one Runtime to the generic MCP server. Adding a Protocol does not modify core, simulator, or generic transport code. MCP and library compositions select the Trusted catalog explicitly:

```ts
const { server } = createMossServer({
  runtime,
  protocols: [myProtocol],
  trustedTokens: [{ address: OFFICIAL_TOKEN_ADDRESS, label: "Official Token" }],
});
```

```ts
const registry = new Registry(runtime, {
  trustedTokens: [{ address: OFFICIAL_TOKEN_ADDRESS, label: "Official Token" }],
}).use(protocols);
```

Registry never discovers Trusted labels from module exports passed to `use`.

Fixed official Monad constants may be imported from `@themoss/system`. Caller-supplied and chain-discovered token addresses remain explicit; do not introduce a package-level token list.

## 7. Tests required for review

- A compile-time fixture proves valid inferred parameter and Receipt names, plus invalid cases marked with `@ts-expect-error`.
- Unit tests cover Registry metadata validation and the Capability's exactly-one-direct-transaction invariant.
- Receipt tests prove complete ordered coverage using the original Change object references, including nested Receipts.
- Failure tests cover missing, duplicated, replaced, and reordered Changes.
- Live Monad-mainnet tests verify fixed addresses and run the happy path with zero Warnings.

Run `pnpm build`, then `pnpm typecheck`, lint, and tests before review.

## 8. Document and submit

Document what the Protocol does, supported contracts or markets, parameter units, defaults, important risks, fixed-address sources, and known limitations.

Export the stable `@Protocol` class from the package entry point. Experimental classes remain internal. Add the package module to the selected application's composition root; generic core and simulator code do not change.

Add a changeset for a user-facing package release:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Open the pull request from a branch based on `main`. Include the live simulation evidence and explain any framework or package-boundary impact. Use the checklist in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
